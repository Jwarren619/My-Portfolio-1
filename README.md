# Creating My Very Own Portfolio (Description)

My goal was to improve my web links to my Github and Gitlab to better help you find my profiles for each site. My CSS helps navigate my positioning of images and helps seperate

# My Installation
 None
# Usage

This is a sort of major project I will be going back and forth with to make it more unique. You can definetly look into my code anytime. Usually I use Command-Option-J, but that is if you have a macbook. Most computers that are not macbooks usually use Control-Shift-J when they are as well using google chrome.

# Road Map🗺

My ideas for the projects going forward will consist of Java Script, HTML & and DOM (Document Object Model).
